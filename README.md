## About
Brainless is a AI web app built in less that 24hours that pulls live weather information and 
runs the data through a neural network to give a prediction of what you should wear and texts you in the morning to let you know if you are to lazy to look. We really couldn't make you do any less... unless we dress you.

## Technology
Full Mean stack app. Mongo, express, angular, bootstrap 4 and deeplearning neural network. Weather underground 3rd party api. Twilio sms api.
